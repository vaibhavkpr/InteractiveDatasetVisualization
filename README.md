# Fuel Economy Data Visualization Project

This project explores various aspects of fuel economy using the Fuel Economy Dataset with 38500 Entries & 81 Attributes (make, fuel type, annual fuel costs, luggage size, engine specifications, etc.). The data is visualized interactively on a website to provide insights into different driving conditions, annual fuel economy and costs, car engine specifications, and popular vehicle makes over the years.

## Topics Explored

### 1. Impact of Driving Conditions on Fuel Economy

Interactive bar plots dynamically showcase MPG vs. drive type. Users can select vehicle class and city/highway options for MPG axis. Relationships between vehicle classes and drive options in terms of fuel economy performance are explored. Smaller vehicle classes and 2-wheel/front wheel drive options generally result in better fuel economy scores in both city and highway conditions.

### 2. Relationship Between Annual Fuel Economy and Costs

A connected dot chart demonstrates the relationship between annual costs and fuel score (1-10). Different drive types are represented by distinct lines, and users can filter by vehicle classes. Hovering over points reveals values in a dialog popup. Results show a linear trend between annual costs and fuel score, with Forward Wheel Drive being notably cheaper compared to other drive types.

### 3. Impact of Car Engine Specifications on Fuel Economy

Interactive line plots analyze the relationship between engine specifications and fuel economy metrics. Users can choose the y-axis metric (annual driving cost or fuel economy in MPG) and select engine specifications such as cylinders, displacement, or fuel type.

### 4. Exploring Popular Vehicle Makes Over the Years

An interactive line plot explores the popularity of vehicle makes over time. Users can move the slider to see the distribution of the top 5 makes in a given year. The dataset reveals changing market shares over time, with American cars dominating early on, and later, European and Japanese cars gaining popularity. It's important to note that these conclusions are based on vehicle registrations and not a comprehensive dataset like Carfax.

## Website Interface

The website provides a clean interface with a menu for users to select specific topics to explore. Interactive visualizations are created using JavaScript & css to allow users to interact with the data effectively.

## How to Use

1. **Visit the Project:** [Fuel Economy Data Visualization](https://rose-mire-catsup.glitch.me/index.html)
2. **Select Topic:** Choose from the menu to explore different aspects of fuel economy.
3. **Interact with Visualizations:** Use interactive features like buttons, dropdowns, and hover functionality to explore the data dynamically.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into fuel economy trends based on different parameters. The interactive nature of the visualizations enhances user engagement and understanding of the dataset.
